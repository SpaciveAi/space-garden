# SpaciveAI - Garden Design Generator

> ✨ **AI-powered layout generation for garden and outdoor spaces.**  
> Transform a simple idea into a buildable landscape plan, automatically.

## 🌱 What is SpaciveAI?

**SpaciveAI** is an intelligent design tool that helps users — from homeowners to landscape professionals — automatically generate conceptual and buildable garden layouts from a few simple prompts or site sketches.

Unlike traditional AI tools that stop at rendering, SpaciveAI aims to generate **editable**, **construction-friendly** outputs like:

- Top-view layout plans
- Visualized paths and planting zones
- Suggested plants, trees, and materials
- Exportable diagrams for further design or construction

## 🚧 MVP Goals

The current focus of this MVP is to:

- [ ] Support users uploading a rough site sketch or entering dimensions
- [ ] Allow selection of design style (e.g., modern, cottage, low-maintenance)
- [ ] Automatically generate:
  - A 2D top-view layout (SVG / canvas based)
  - Optional AI-generated moodboard / visual inspiration
- [ ] Enable users to edit generated plans (drag, delete, re-style)
- [ ] Export layout to PDF / PNG

> 🧪 MVP is under active development — all feedback welcome!

## 🌐 Future Vision

While we start with garden spaces, SpaciveAI is designed to grow into a general-purpose AI layout tool for:

- 🏡 **Interior design**
- 🛋️ Furniture staging
- 🏙️ Urban courtyards or pocket parks
- 🎨 Spatial design inspiration for creators

We envision collaboration with design influencers, professionals, and AI creators.
